## About

#### Hi! Myself Amit Agarwal (A Student)

I'm currently in class 12th at the Reliable Institue, Kota, Rajasthan. I live in India, my passion is to think new and create new.
I maked many projects for challenges, I passed out [MLH CTF challenges](https://challenges.mlh.io) and [Google CTF Challenges](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com) in mid 2020.
I keep on participating in hackathons of [MLH](https://mlh.io).
I never cross deadlines and very curious everytime to solve a new challenge.
